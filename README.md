# Some of the code for the Rover Matrix project. 


### Waiting for the permission from the science club to use the rest of my code here...

## What this is:

As an "entry project" to get into my science club I was supposed to complete a chosen project. The one I have chosen was designig, constructing and programming a LED adressable matrix. The matrix would then be used on various event as a "show off feature" and later after weight-optimization used to signalize some of the rover vitals states. 

The project was completed, although is yet to be optimised and implemented in more of a practical use...
