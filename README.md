# Some of the code for the Rover Matrix project
## What this is:

To gain entry into my science club (Robotics Science Club (KNR)), I had to undertake a project of my choice. I opted to design, build, and program a LED addressable matrix that could be showcased at various events. Eventually, after optimizing its weight, the matrix would be used to indicate some of the rover's vital states.

I have completed the project, but it still needs further optimization and practical implementation.
